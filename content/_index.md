### Ingredients:
- 1 1/4 cups all purpuse flour
- 5 eggs at room temperature
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt

#### Method:
1. Add the eggs to a large mixing bowl.
2. Add the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt to the eggs.
3. Mix continuously for 20 minutes using an electric mixer. The mixture will thicken and double in size.
4. Sift in the dry ingredients - flour and baking powder- and fold gently using a spatula until the ingredients are well combined.
